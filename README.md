# FloppyBit
A flappy bird clone but uses custom art done by me. 

This was done for a final project in my web development class. 

I didn't want to overcomplicate it by allowing it to be connected to a DB, plus then every person who uses it would need to set up a DB connection. 
It uses a txt file to emulate a database. 

## Skills Learned/leveraged
* HTML
* Javascript 
* PHP (for CRUD usage and connecting to a psuedo-database to log users in)
