# FloppyBit 
A flappy bird clone but uses custom art done by me. 

[Live Here](https://floppy-bit.herokuapp.com/)

This was done for a final project in my web development class. 

I didn't want to overcomplicate it by allowing it to be connected to a DB, plus then every person who uses it would need to set up a DB connection. 
It uses a txt file to emulate a database. 
  **This is currently not working...* 
  **So to test it out. Use test, test to login and play.**
